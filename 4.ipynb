    "The Davies-Bouldin Index (DB index) is a metric used to evaluate the quality of a clustering result. It measures the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar neighboring cluster, taking into account both the compactness of clusters and the separation between them. Lower values of the DB index indicate better clustering results, with values closer to zero representing more compact and well-separated clusters.\n",

    "Finally, the DB index is computed as the average of the maximum similarity values for all clusters in the dataset.\n",
    "Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower values of the DB index indicate better clustering results, with values closer to zero representing clusters that are more compact and well-separated.\n",
    "The DB index considers both the compactness of clusters (how tightly packed the data points are within each cluster) and the separation between clusters (how distinct the clusters are from each other).\n",
    "A high DB index suggests that the clustering may have resulted in overlapping clusters or clusters that are too spread out, indicating poor separation between clusters or excessive cluster dispersion.\n",
    "Range of Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "The DB index typically ranges from zero to positive infinity.\n",
    "A value of zero indicates perfect clustering, where each cluster is compact and well-separated from other clusters.\n",
    "Higher values of the DB index indicate worse clustering results, with larger values indicating greater overlap or spread of clusters.\n",
    "While there is no upper bound for the DB index, practical values are usually within a reasonable range based on the characteristics of the dataset and the clustering algorithm used."
