    "Homogeneity and completeness are two metrics commonly used to evaluate the quality of clustering results, particularly in the context of evaluating the performance of clustering algorithms. These metrics provide insights into how well clusters align with ground truth labels or class assignments when available.\n",

    "\n",
    "Homogeneity and completeness scores range between 0 and 1, where a score of 1 indicates perfect homogeneity or completeness.\n",
    "High homogeneity indicates that each cluster predominantly contains data points from a single class, while high completeness indicates that all data points from a given class are assigned to the same cluster.\n",
    "However, homogeneity and completeness are not always maximized simultaneously. A clustering result may achieve high homogeneity but low completeness or vice versa, depending on the clustering algorithm and the nature of the data."
