    "The Silhouette Coefficient is a metric used to evaluate the quality of clustering results by measuring the compactness and separation of clusters. It provides a measure of how well-separated clusters are and how similar data points are within the same cluster compared to neighboring clusters. The Silhouette Coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where:\n",

    "A value close to +1 indicates that data points are well-clustered, with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity. This suggests that clusters are dense and well-separated from each other.\n",
    "A value close to 0 indicates overlapping clusters, where data points at cluster boundaries may be similar to points in neighboring clusters. This suggests that clusters are not clearly defined.\n",
